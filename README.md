Git repository for Daniel Long's COMP2013 Coursework

Initially worked on javadocs to help me understand what each Class was responsible for

Refactor the code into different packages to allow for easier management and to make the packages meaningful

Rename Controller class to PlaySpaceController, renamed sample.fxml to GameView.fxml

Created Class MenuBarController to hold controller methods for the menu bar, allowing the Main class to be made smaller.

Created class Load and Save to refactor methods from StartMeUp nd Main in order to improve single responsibility and encapsulation.

All menu features that came implemented with the original src have been implemented.

Methods refactored from main into the controller class to allow main to have a single responsibility of starting the controller.
